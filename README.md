In this task, the objective was to identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample and demonstrate how basic cybersecurity tools can uncover malicious intent. The email claimed to be from the “PayPal Security Team” but actually originated from security@paypai.com, a cleverly spoofed domain. The body used urgent language—warning of permanent account suspension within 24 hours—and included a fake login link (https://paypal-verification-center.com/login). I submitted that URL to VirusTotal, where 1 out of 97 security vendors flagged it as phishing, confirming the risk of credential theft. Next, I pasted the raw header into the Google Admin Toolbox MessageHeader analyzer and observed that SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all failed, proving the sender was unauthorized and the message could not be authenticated. The email also featured a generic greeting (“Dear Customer”) rather than personalizing the recipient’s name, and, despite its polished grammar, these very qualities increase its deceptive power. This underlines the importance of combining header inspection and link reputation checks and other such tools to detect and defend against phishing attempts.
